âœ¨<b>Hello, I'm Pedroâœ¨ ðŸ”—blockchain enthusiasts , Tecnology & Solving problemas for you in Engenering and IT </b>

I am a passionate individual with a diverse set of interests ranging from mechanical engineering to computer science and AI. My curiosity and love for technology have led me to explore various programming languages and technologies, including security and database management.

### My Background and Experience

I have always been fascinated with the possibilities of artificial intelligence and have gained a significant amount of experience working with bots that perform actions in Pearl code. During the pandemic, I developed my skills further in Python and built a bot that uses virtual machines to centralize data processing. I am a strong advocate and admirer of technology and its potential to transform the world.
